# Physics Next App

A physics simulation app built using **Matter.js**. The app provides a simple interface for manipulating physics simulations with customizable settings and interactive features.

## Features

### 1. **Edit Gravity**
   - Allows users to adjust the gravitational force in the simulation.
   - Gravity can be modified in both the X and Y axes for more customized simulations.

### 2. **Bulk Create Particles**
   - Users can generate multiple particles at once by specifying a quantity and randomizing their properties (position, size, velocity).
   - Great for testing large-scale particle systems or visual effects.

### 3. **Create Other Shapes**
   - Users can create not just circles, but also squares, triangles, and custom polygonal shapes.
   - These shapes can be dynamically resized and placed in the simulation.

### 4. **Undo Button**
   - Allows users to revert any unwanted changes or actions.
   - Whether it's adding a new particle or adjusting settings, the undo feature offers flexibility and control over the simulation.
     
### 5. **Mobile Friendly**
  - The app is fully optimized for mobile devices, providing a smooth and responsive experience.

## Technologies Used

- **Matter.js**: A 2D physics engine for the web, used for collision detection, gravity, and object interactions.
- **HTML5 Canvas**: For rendering the simulation visually in the browser.
- **JavaScript**: For app logic, event handling, and interaction with Matter.js.

## Future Features (Planned)

- **Save and Load Simulation**: Save the current state of the simulation and load it later.
- **Particle Interaction Settings**: Adjust properties like friction, restitution (bounciness), and density for each particle.
